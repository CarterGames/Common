## How to install
Simply download the repo and import its contents into Unity or download the latest release and import the package into Unity with the custom package import. In the future there will be the git URL option as well, but that is a bit down the line. 

## Docs
The docs for the project are still a work in progress. Each script is fairly well commented as is but it will all be documented over time before a full 1.x release.
