# Erissa Library
> Version 0.1.0

A work in progress code library of verified systems that I use in my projects made publically available with documentation for all parts of the project. This will be updated in small steps as each system is tested and to ensure it works as it was intended before being publically released to the main branch. 

## Branches
- Main - The branch you should get the latest version of the project from.
- Release - The branch that I use to prep changes to the main branch.
- Develop - The branch where I commit work in progress changes to the project. Work in this branch should be considered unstable.

## How to install
Simply download the repo and import its contents into Unity or download the latest release and import the package into Unity with the custom package import. In the future there will be the git URL option as well, but that is a bit down the line. 

## Docs
Full documentatio for all the scripts can be found in the wiki section:
